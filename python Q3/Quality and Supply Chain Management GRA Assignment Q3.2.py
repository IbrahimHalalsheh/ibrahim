# The histograms are skewed to the right, which indicates:
#     1. The majority of the values are concentrated toward the lower end of the range, which indicates that most them have
#     lower values.
#     2. The mean of the distribution is larger than the median. This implies that there are some high values that pull the
#     mean towards the right.
#     3. Variability in the values, where some characteristics have relatively higher values compared to the majority of
#     characteristics with lower values.
#     4. Possibility of outliers on the right end of the distribution.
#     5. The distribution is Non-symmetrical, which should be taken into account when further analyzing and interpreting the
#     data.
